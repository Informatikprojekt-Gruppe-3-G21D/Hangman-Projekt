# Hangman game
This is a Hangman game programmed with Python. It chooses a random word and asks you to guess it. If you guess wrong, the typical hangman figure is drawn piece by piece. If you can't guess the word with less than 6 mistakes, you lose. 
### Why did we choose Python? What difficulties did we encounter? 
Python is an ideal programming language to write small projects with. Nevertheless, we had some problems, especially with semantics, but we were able to solve all the problems without having to copy certain parts from other projects shared on the internet.

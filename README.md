# Hangman game
This is a Hangman game programmed with Python. It chooses a random word and asks you to guess it, letter by letter. If your guess is wrong, the typical hangman figure is drawn piece by piece. If you can't guess the word with less than 6 mistakes, you lose.  
### Why did we choose Python? What difficulties did we encounter? 
Python is an ideal programming language to write small projects with. Nevertheless, we did face some problems, especially with semantics, but we were able to solve all the problems without having to copy certain parts from other projects shared on the internet. Despite that, we did use the instructions on the Website: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ for some problems we encountered, but we never directly copied anything they published. 
### Requirements for usage: 
- Download all pygame libraries (https://www.pygame.org/download.shtml)
- Download all the files listed in our repository and move them to the same folder
- Open the folder in an interpreter (f.e. VS Code) and run the file "Hangman final Version.py"
Now you should be able to play Hangman!
